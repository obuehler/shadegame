CS 4152 Spring 2016

Shade is an action game that combines fast-paced action with stealth. In each level, the player controls the shadow of a person. The shadow has been separated from the person, who is wandering off somewhere else in the level, and the playerâ€™s aim is to catch up with them before time runs out and they set out to another destination. In doing this, however, the player cannot move freely; without a caster, the shadow fades away quickly in the sunlight. In order not to lose, the player must use the protection of other shadows cast by the objects of the 3D world around them--buildings, trees, cars, people, etc.

All of the code can be found in Shade/Classes. To build the project, simply pull and choose the .sln file from inside the appropriate build directory inside Shade directory. The architecture follows an MVC pattern and each filename is tagged with M_ or C_ based on whether is is a model or controller class.
